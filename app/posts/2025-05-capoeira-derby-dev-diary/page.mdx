# Capoeira Derby Dev Diary

I've begun this project because the old Capoeira website is not optimal, in a number of ways.

First, it has no photos. This sort of thing needs to be 80% photos. Pictures speak a thousand words.

Second, the website theme feels out of date, and has subtle bugs that I don't know how to fix. I have no doubt I could
improve the theme and work out the bugs, but given that it is built using wordpress, I also have no doubt that it would
take me as long to work out the bugs as it would to build it from scratch using React/NextJS.

Finally, the information on the website is out of date. This is relatively easy to update, especially in wordpress, but
it is unpleasant, and if I need to do any updates other than text, I am left grappling with the wordpress admin UI
again.

Combine all of these things and I have landed on the conclusion that it will be easier to build it from scratch than it
will be to update this website.

### Aim: Replace the website?

I really was not sure how far I could get in one day. I hoped I'd get a functioning website churned out, though this was
certainly ambitious.

What I've actually gotten done is this:

<div className={`flex items-center justify-center`}>
  <Image
    src="/dev/capoeira-derby-home-page.png"
    alt={`A screenshot of the Capoeira Derby web page.`}
    width={300}
    height={300}
  />
</div>

The website theme and layout is taking shape. I have a working header with links, a nice friendly banner photo with all
of us smiling, a friendly colourful tagline and more photos alongside an introduction to the Derby Capoeira group.

There are a number of things left to do though. The theme is taking shape... but far from complete. The colours are
blunt and could be more subtle and complimentary.

The links don't yet go anywhere, and are unstyled, as are the CTAs.

The images could do with a bit of blending into the page.

The footer is incomplete.

It is not hosted nor deployed anywhere.

The page is totally unresponsive:

<div className={`flex items-center justify-center`}>
  <Image
    src="/dev/capoeira-derby-mobile-unresponsive.png"
    alt={`A screenshot of the Capoeira Derby web page in mobile mode. It does not look good.`}
    width={300}
    height={300}
  />
</div>

So certainly lots left to do!

But it has been rewarding work so far. Anything that helps channel traffic to the Capoeira group makes me happy.

I'd love to have this done by the end of next weekend.

**Next time:** Add some of the pages, starting with 'what is Capoeira?'

## 04/03/2025

### Aim: Add 'What is Capoeira?' page

Yep, certainly managed that! A couple of beers has certainly helped me not to overthink this.

I've added the new page, abstracted a few common components and made some of the standard things look a little bit
better.

<div className={`flex items-center justify-center`}>
  <Image
    src="/dev/capoeira-what-is-page.png"
    alt={`A screenshot of the new 'What is Capoeira?' page.`}
    width={300}
    height={300}
  />
</div>

It's been fun. Still quite a few pages left to add, but it's proper flow zone stuff. Easy-ish but a few tricky bits,
enough to not make me bored, plus it's nice to think about it actually being used and directing people to the group in a
positive way!

**Next time:** Add the next page - can i do Capoeira, think about making it responsive.

## 05/03/2025

### Aim: Add 'Can I do Capoeira?' page

The page specified above has indeed been added! I've had to take out a page talking about portuguese because it came
with a glossary, which I can't be bothered to add, and a section talking about Ligerinho's qualifications, which won't
work because he's no longer in the group!

It has made me question whether we ought to perhaps create a more standard FAqs page, and a separate page for some of
the sections within it - like one to talk about the instructors. Or could this be part of the 'Our Group' page? Perhaps.
For now I think I keep transcribing over the existing pages and we see how it goes when I've moved all of them over, we
see what else I'm missing.

Also... I've made it responsive!

<div className={`flex items-center justify-center`}>
  <Image
    src="/dev/responsive-capoeira.png"
    alt={`A screenshot of the newly responsive home page.`}
    width={300}
    height={300}
  />
</div>

Next time, I'm going to do the next page - classes - which might not be so simple. I think there is a better way to lay
out that information, which I will not at all try to work out myself, I will just ask ChatGPT!

## 08/03/2025

### Aim: Add the classes page

Added! This page was not as satisfying as the others. I've changed the layout quite a lot because it was shit before,
and is now... less shit but there are still issues.

<div className={`flex items-center justify-center`}>
  <Image
    src="/dev/capoeira-derby-classes-page.png"
    alt={`a screenshot of the new classes page.`}
    width={300}
    height={300}
  />
</div>

There is some text above the class cards that is a bit of a tagline but is styled more like a header - that needs a bit
more thought.

The address on the cards is formatted poorly, and the text on the cards generally is probably a bit small.

Finally, the CTA box at the bottom of the page is a bit bland. It feels like it needs to be a bit flashier. But those
are problems for another time.

There are a few of these 'problems for another time' mounting up. I sense that the final 10% of building this website
will not be as smooth as the initial 90%...

One last thing, I've been using ChatGPT heavily for layout suggestions on this page, too heavily. It's making my brain
feel sluggish. It makes me feel like I can't trust my own thoughts, like I must offload any problems onto ChatGPT. The
balance has not been right. Next time, I think I need to at least have an idea before I ask, or ask and then attempt to
implement it myself. Either way, ask and then try something, and then ask and then try something else. Not just chain
together multiple asks.

Ah, finally finally for real this time - I had a bit of a think (and also queried ChatGPT) on the layout. I think it's
not far off right as it is, but I think we can possibly combine the Capoeira history page and our group page, along with
adding some other bits.

We should also rename the 'can I do Capoeira' to FAQs, or something more standard like that.

So final page list could be:

- Home
- About (Our group, history of capoeira, expectations for new students)
  - Instructors - more info on a separate page
  - link off for a history of capoeira (or something - maybe links to Manchester or something like that)
- Classes
- Events (maybe hide this for now)
- Contact (just for ease of scanning)

Next time: Think more on this layout. Add the 'Our Group' page and think about maybe combining the pages.

## 09/03/2025

### Aim: Add the 'Our Group' page

Adding went well! The page lives! I had to add more about the instructors now, and less about the controversy of leaving
Cordao de Ouro.

Technically, it was cool to see that I can just add the video directly too. It was more trouble converting the video
into mp4 format rather than actually embedding it in the page.

I also started to clean up the page a little bit. There were a few unresponsive bits and a few other little fixes to do.

The only things left to do now are to decide on the final list of pages, do a bit of QA and finally actually host the
thing on github so people can actually see it!

Next time: Finally decide on and implement the final list of pages.

### Aim: Finish it off

It has been a week since I really got any time to work on this. I was extremely busy - my free days were eaten by
Capoeira lesson planning, illness and gigs.

Now though, I have a week off. For the rest of the week I'll be recording, but today I have a free day, and I wanted to
finish this website. At least, from a development perspective.

What did that entail though?

- Combining the 'our group' and 'What is Capoeira' pages into a single 'About' page
- Add a not found page
- Change the 'Can I do Capoeira?' page to an FAQs page
- Copious minor bug fixing
- Hosting the website in github pages, and adding github actions pipelines to build it
- Adding a custom font
- Getting permissions from the parents to show images of their children on the internet

Wow, it's a lot when I spell it out like that.

Did I get it all done? Of course I did!

I started with adding the About page and renaming FAQs, along with some minor bug fixes around the menu layout and
changing links to those pages. That was easy enough if a little time consuming.

Next I decided to host the thing. THAT was harder. Despite it being exactly the same as what I've done before with my
blog, it still took over an hour with a fair bit of trial and error in various config files before i got it working.

Especially noteworthy is the fact that I added some background images this time, and embedded a video. The NExt `Image`
component has it's own way of dealing with image paths which I have had to deal with before with my blog, however the
background images and videos do NOT work that way, so I've had to do a rather ugly hack to prepend the repository
endpoint onto the front of the image and video file names.

<div className={`flex items-center justify-center`}>
  <Image
    src="/dev/capoeira-derby-ugly-prepend.png"
    alt={`a screenshot of some damn ugly code.`}
    width={300}
    height={300}
  />
</div>

But eventually it was all working. Until I realised I had forgotten to add a font, so then I spent 30 minutes fighting
with google fonts, tailwind, css and chatgpt to work out how to upload and use my font of choice.

A quick round of QA from Chris to iron out a couple of minor bugs, then permissions sent off to parents.

Was it all worth it? I think the final product is looking pretty good...

<div className={`flex items-center justify-center`}>
  <Image src="/dev/capoeira-derby-final-home.png" alt={`a screenshot of the final site.`} width={300} height={300} />
</div>

Next time (and the final time?): Implement any required changes due to feedback then get it deployed by working with
Dave.

## 19/04/2025

It has been shared, and feedback has been received. It's mainly positive. Chris was able to point out some minor flaws,
but that is all.

Just waiting on Dave being free so that I can deploy it to the correct URL, then we're done!

## 10/05/2025

This dropped off my radar a bit but finally Dave and I were both free to get this thing live. Due to DNS propagation
causing weird errors it took way longer than it should have, but it is now finally out there.

# Summary

It is out there. Initially I hoped I could have it done within a week. Two and a half months later, it has finally been
deployed. So a little over the initial estimate. In fairness a lot of it was just getting two very busy people together
in order to actually deploy the thing, it was functionally complete within about a week of work.

And am I happy with it? Yes I am! We now have a website which:

- Will be easy to update (at least for me)
- Looks modern
- Looks friendly and inviting - I think it does a better job of advertising Capoeira in Derby.

Have I learned anything?

First, making basic websites for things is perfectly within my skillset, and what's more, it's actually quite fun!

Second, doing the work alongside a dev diary is good for my mental health. It gives me the illusion of progress when a
session has been tough, it gives me a record of how long things have taken that I can look back on and it helps me to
punctuate the end of a session. I sometimes have trouble turning my mind off after working on a side project, this helps
to gently ease my mind out of it. Also, to be frank the activity of committing to two projects simultaneously on github
looks good to prospective employers...

Third, I'm bad at estimating. I underestimate everything, always. I already knew this but the evidence is here now.

# Derwent - From the clutches of Industry finally into the country

As you take the rustic stile down next to Borrowash Bridge, the river quickens it's flow, as if happy to finally get
it's first glimpse of proper countryside after it's long slow trudge through Derby.

There are still signs of civilization mingled into the scene, but the balance feels more healthy. Across on the far
bank, there are some houses behind the fields. On the near bank, a line of telegraph poles pick their unassuming way
across the fallows, on a quiet mission of their own. The ambient drone of a train hums bodily through the chill air
and frosted ground.

The path follows the curves of the Derwent, it's close companion. It is well-trodden, but no longer tarmaced over, as
when it was still in the grips of the City.

The trees and plants seem healthier and more diverse now. It feels like they too like being out of the grips of
industry, with space to stretch and flourish. No more tense, desperate thickets of bramble filling all space not taken
by tarmac and concrete - here there is space for all.

As I walk, I observe bleached brown branches in untidy stacks dotted here and there along the riverside. Part of me
attributes this to some eccentric goblin, arranging sticks for some esoteric purpose, while a different part of me
understands that they must have been washed this way by flooding. Though even that part of me cannot explain why the
branches are so grouped together. A mystery.

The path meanders on with the gentle bends of the river, and the fields grow more numerous on both sides of the bank.
As I cast my eyes across the rutted, earthen green, I can't help but wonder how this might look in ten years.
Will it too be a new estate of luxury town housing and apartments, perfect for young professionals and families?

I quicken my pace to dispel my bleak thoughts of the future. Pools of reflected sky in the next field lend further
evidence to my rational self's assessment of flooding from a few fields back. The fields are very flat, and the pools
stretch on into the distance and I wonder how bad the flooding must get when it rains. I am selfishly thankful that
it has been a dry few days.

A true country gate complete with a quaint way marker gives me a jolt of warm joy. I cross it into a small copse of
brown winter trees. It is hushed, intimate. Just me, the river and birdsong.

On the left of the path, between me and the bank, there are no living plants smaller than trees. All is a rolling
blanket of dead brittle stalks, lying close to the ground, like the hastily smoothed hair of a corpse.

I question what caused this widespread destruction? Simple frost or cataclysmic flood? Either way, the rational part
of my mind prevails here - I can't see it being the work of the Derwent goblins, like with the dead wood from before.

I still occasionally pass others - dog walkers and ramblers - but they are fewer now. Rare enough that I startle a
couple of mallards into flight as I round a tree.

The claws of industry have almost been eluded now, yet still obvious signs of civilization remain. Flood flotsam
pervades the spiky brown stalks. Plastic bottles and the inevitable plastic bags, almost always in that unnatural
deep shade of blue that you can only get from corner shops. In the shallows, a dull silty white sheet lurks like some
predatory fish, but more ominous. It will still be there long after the lifespans of anything living in the river now.

Suddenly, I am ushered from the bank side by a way marker and onto a gnarled, uneven field of short winter grass. The
path becomes a faint brown line, striking out diagonally across the field away from the river.

Away from the river and out of the copse, I am unsheltered and the wind whips cold around me. Other than an occasional
wind brushing the trees and bubbling in my ears, it is quiet now. Even the incessant hiss of traffic, which I had been
unconsciously blocking out until now, is muted here.

At the opposite edge of the field, I cross a stile with a charmingly simple sliding gate contraption for letting small
four-legged friends pass. I reflect that my city upbringing betrays me here, and that it was probably made with sheep
in mind, not dogs as the primary customer.

Beyond is another field, bumpier, with tufts of marsh grass growing around boggy pools. The edges of the field are
trenched, with a trickle of stream running through, and tiny, secret, vivid green plants growing within.

I cross the remains of a ruined stile and cross the corner of the next field, where I pass close to a huge felled
branch, like the antler of some enormous deer. Perhaps the deer is the god of the Derwent goblins, and those piles of
branches were mini shrines? It all begins to make sense.

I cross the next few fields without any real thought, enveloped in the green, blue, cold and natural quiet. Almost
trance-like, but I am fully aware of my surroundings, more so than I have been all day, maybe even all week. I am
content.

Finally, inevitably, my thinking-mind cuts in. It observes that I am calm, the stress that I didn't even realise was
there has been released. Let out to harmlessly drift away on the wind into the endless blue.

I walk on, happy, no longer worrying too much about the past or future.

I come to the edge of a small village and am greeted again by civilization, but gently, in a way that feels more
sustainable.

I observe that I have found what I was looking for, even though I did not realise I was searching. Here, finally,
I find no obligations, no sense that I must maximise productivity, no commitments. The birds and the village expect
nothing and I will happily give it.

My thinking-mind questions - is it really on the edge of this village that I've found this feeling, or is it within
myself? I know the answer, but it is with a hint of sadness that I wonder why I can't reach this feeling at will.

I know the tension will return when I get back to the city but for now I stop with that line of inquiry and simply
enjoy being out and part of the world.

# The Symphony of the Train

First you are hit by the smell. Sickly sweet overtones hiding a fetid undercurrent. The smell of the sweat of thousands
of bodies and sick and spilt alcohol, all barely masked by the overpowering chemicals of cleaning products, applied
neglectfully by humans who are underpaid and overworked and therefore simply do not care.

Next, the noise. The ceaseless hum of machinery. The very slight variances in pitch and lack of pattern to those
variances give it a maddening edge, like a song with a melody that we cannot quite grasp but it pervades our ears
completely. Ambivalent groans, that of giant toddler, unaware that the constancy will drive their parents to madness.

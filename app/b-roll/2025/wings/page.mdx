# Wings

On a clear summer morning, I awoke with wings.

You could tell it would be a hot day. No clouds, just deep astronomical blue from horizon to horizon.

The wings grew from a place in the center of my shoulderblades and stretched out ten feet each, from tip to base. They
were feathered, a deep brown with speckles of whites and lighter browns towards the tips of certain feathers.

In shape, they were that of a great bird of prey, like an eagle.

I could stretch them out or fold them in at will. When folded, the tops protruded just above my head and the tips
finished just before the ground.

It felt like wearing a large, bulky backpack, except lighter, far lighter than it should have been for the size.

In fact, my whole body felt light. I didn't know it then but my whole physiology had changed. My back, chest and
shoulder muscles had changed shape to support my new wings. My bones had become hollow and weaker, but lighter - more
suited to flight.

Movement felt good, but suddenly I felt confined. I yearned for the outside.

I made my way through the house to the garden. Navigating doorways and around furniture was cumbersome and awkward with
my new bulky form. I felt too large for the house and it sat on my mind like a weight, until I brushed through the back
door and reached the outside, where the weight suddenly became a balloon, and floated away into the sky.

Immediately, I felt the infinite azure call to me, and I knew I must go to it.

I hopped experimentally and flexed out my wings. As I moved to the left and right, I used my wings to stabilise me. At
first my corrections were either too small - mere twitches that did little to stop my momentum, or too large - great
wing beats that threw me back the other way. Very quickly I worked out the balance, and it began to feel natural.

The lightness was intoxicating. I wondered how I had lived with my slow, heavy body from before.

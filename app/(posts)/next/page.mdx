# Why I've been avoiding Next.js

*14th October 2024*

I'm a software engineer with some ten years of experience, five years of that being with React. So why have I never used
next.js before?

## What is next.js?

Next.js is a React framework, which in this case basically means it is vanilla React, plus a few extra bells and
whistles. Things like typescript, a file-based router, tailwind, server-side generation and much more.

On the whole, I like all the things bundled up with next.js, so what has been putting me off using it in the past?

## Weaknesses of next.js

I was already reasonably familiar with React when I first came across next.js. At that time, I wasn't interested in
it for two reasons. First I couldn't understand what benefits it had over vanilla React and second
it seemed overly complicated.

### Unclear benefits

On the first point - my statement isn't entirely correct. I understood what next.js offered, but it just didn't really
seem like a benefit **to me**.

- It offered file-based routing - but I already understood how to use `react-router`.
- It offered typescript - but it was easy enough to include this in a vanilla React project with an hour or so
of configuration.
- It offered nebulous 'SEO optimisations' - but I didn't really need to prioritise SEO.
- It offered performance increases - but I'd never found React to be 'too slow'.
- It offered API routes - but I could easily create a separate back-end API that could handle these things perfectly
well.

This leads us to the second point:

### It seemed overly complicated

Vanilla React is plenty complicated enough already. When you start mixing in server-side generation and static pages,
along with lots of other small optimisations, it's a lot of extra stuff to learn.

On top of this, the new features bring new questions when it's time to deploy the app.
Do I generate a static site or do I try to host it like a traditional web app?
In which case, what do I do about scaling the app? How does it handle state?

## Hype

From my viewpoint, the complexities were off-putting and the upsides were not worth it, yet next.js was, and is, very
popular.

This lead me to conclude that it had been **over-hyped** by the development community and was being used to solve
problems for which it was not well suited, similar to the way mongodb and graphql (amongst many others)
had been misused in the past (and perhaps continue to be misused now).

### And yet...

When I initially started writing this post, I began convinced that my past self was correct, that next.js was over-hyped
and that there were no **real** upsides to it, unless you really valued SEO, or had a huge devops team or something
like that.

Looking at it today as a more experienced developer, I see that next.js was and is probably fine, my harsh view
came from where I was in my development career at that time.

- I didn't need any of the added tools (typescript, tailwind etc.) bundling automatically because I already knew about
them and had used them, but would that be the case to a junior developer?
- I had worked as a back-end developer for years before also starting on front-end development, so of course API routes
don't appeal to me, but would they appeal if you were less familiar with back-end development generally?
- I had mainly worked in startups so I had to worry about deployment myself, but if you had a large, experienced devops
team, would the hosting options be as daunting?
- I had learned how to structure projects to protect against spaghetti code, but if I were a new junior developer,
wouldn't the file-based router help with that?
- I didn't care about SEO when building B2B apps, but if I was making a B2C website would that be the case?

Once I take my specific scenario out of the equation and consider how it might help developers from all different
backgrounds, I can see why next.js is popular.

Indeed, now that I lead teams myself, I can see that some of the benefits to junior developers would help our
team in general, even if it doesn't help me specifically. For that reason alone I would seriously consider using
next.js in future projects.

Perhaps next.js is being used to solve problems to which another technology may be better suited, but it is
unfair to blame next.js for that. This is likely true for any popular technology, including the aforementioned mongodb,
and graphql. The only criticism I could feasibly leverage at next.js around that is that they could make it clearer
when and when not to use their framework.

## Conclusion

I came into this post hoping to write a scathing yet justified takedown of next.js - the monster hype framework
beguiling developers into it's clutches with false promises. Not consciously, but it's clear to me now that it is what
my ego wanted.

The truth is next.js seems just fine. It seems like there are a lot of scenarios in which it would be useful,
and the only reason I hadn't used it previously is that the upsides were not particularly useful to me.

This may not be a profound conclusion, but I'm glad I was able to identify my unconscious bias against
next.js. It has acted as a reminder for me to always question my beliefs, even in something as small as a preference
for a front-end framework.

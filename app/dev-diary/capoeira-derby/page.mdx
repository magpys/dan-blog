# Capoeira Derby Dev Diary

I've begun this project because the old Capoeira website is not optimal, in a number of ways.

First, it has no photos. This sort of thing needs to be 80% photos. Pictures speak a thousand words with these things.

Second, the website theme feels out of date, and has subtle bugs that I don't know how to fix. I have no doubt I could
improve the theme and work out the bugs, but given that it is built using wordpress, I also have no doubt that it would
take me as long to work out the bugs as it would to build it from scratch using React/NextJS.

Finally, the information on the website is out of date. This is relatively easy to update, especially in wordpress, but
it is unpleasant, and if I need to do any updates other than text, I am left grappling with the wordpress admin UI
again.

Combine all of these things and I have landed on the conclusion that it will be easier to build it from scratch than it
will be to update this website.

### Aim: Replace the website?

I really was not sure how far I could get in one day. I hoped I'd get a functioning website churned out, though this was
certainly ambitious.

What I've actually gotten done is this:

<div className={`flex items-center justify-center`}>
  <Image
    src="/dev/capoeira-derby-home-page.png"
    alt={`A screenshot of the Capoeira Derby web page.`}
    width={300}
    height={300}
  />
</div>

The website theme and layout is taking shape. I have a working header with links, a nice friendly banner photo with all
of us smiling, a friendly colourful tagline and more photos alongside an introduction to the Derby Capoeira group.

There are a number of things left to do though. The theme is taking shape... but far from complete. The colours are
blunt and could be more subtle and complimentary.

The links don't yet go anywhere, and are unstyled, as are the CTAs.

The images could do with a bit of blending into the page.

The footer is incomplete.

It is not hosted nor deployed anywhere.

The page is totally unresponsive:

<div className={`flex items-center justify-center`}>
  <Image
    src="/dev/capoeira-derby-mobile-unresponsive.png"
    alt={`A screenshot of the Capoeira Derby web page in mobile mode. It does not look good.`}
    width={300}
    height={300}
  />
</div>

So certainly lots left to do!

But it has been rewarding work so far. Anything that helps channel traffic to the Capoeira group makes me happy.

I'd love to have this done by the end of next weekend.

**Next time:** Add some of the pages, starting with 'what is Capoeira?'

### Aim: Add 'What is Capoeira?' page

Yep, certainly managed that! A couple of beers has certainly helped me not to overthink this.

I've added the new page, abstracted a few common components and made some of the standard things look a little bit
better.

<div className={`flex items-center justify-center`}>
  <Image
    src="/dev/capoeira-what-is-page.png"
    alt={`A screenshot of the new 'What is Capoeira?' page.`}
    width={300}
    height={300}
  />
</div>

It's been fun. Still quite a few pages left to add, but it's proper flow zone stuff. Easy-ish but a few tricky bits,
enough to not make me bored, plus it's nice to think about it actually being used and directing people to the group in a
positive way!

**Next time:** Add the next page - can i do Capoeira, think about making it responsive.

### Aim: Add 'Can I do Capoeira?' page

The page specified above has indeed been added! I've had to take out a page talking about portuguese because it came
with a glossary, which I can't be bothered to add, and a section talking about Ligerinho's qualifications, which won't
work because he's no longer in the group!

It has made me question whether we ought to perhaps create a more standard FAqs page, and a separate page for some of
the sections within it - like one to talk about the instructors. Or could this be part of the 'Our Group' page? Perhaps.
For now I think I keep transcribing over the existing pages and we see how it goes when I've moved all of them over, we
see what else I'm missing.

Also... I've made it responsive!

<div className={`flex items-center justify-center`}>
  <Image
    src="/dev/responsive-capoeira.png"
    alt={`A screenshot of the newly responsive home page.`}
    width={300}
    height={300}
  />
</div>

Next time, I'm going to do the next page - classes - which might not be so simple. I think there is a better way to lay
out that information, which I will not at all try to work out myself, I will just ask ChatGPT!

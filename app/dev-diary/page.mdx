# Dev Diary

I wish to capture my progress while developing this game, mainly as inspiration to myself, to see how far I have come
over time.

I'm capturing it here instead of in notebooks so that I can take screenshots. Pictures can be worth a thousand words,
especially when you're iterating on one thing. It can be hard to remember the old versions of a thing.

### Aim: Give my generated blob a pattern.

There is a pattern, and it generates anew each time in a satisfying way.

<div className={`flex items-center justify-center`}>
  <Image
    src="dev/pattern-blob.png"
    alt={`A pattern, inexpertly applied to a crude drawing of a blob.`}
    width={300}
    height={300}
  />
</div>

The eagle eyed amongst you might notice that it leaves the confines of the blob's body in a way that even a 3-year-old
could not be proud of though.

It is NOT fully random, each pixel is determined crudely by the pixels that came before it. If most of them directly
above and to the left are orange, then this one will also be orange.

Next time, I want to clean up the edges so it looks less like a drawing of a blob that has glitched out and more like a
blob with a fetching pattern.

### Aim: Make the pattern stay within the blob bounds

I did not achieve this! It turns out that it is actually quite difficult to make only the pattern within the stroke
visible and the rest invisible without writing it pixel by pixel.

There must be a nicer way to do this.

How about if we also determine the shape of the blob randomly? Then we need not worry about canvas, we only need to
worry about making it a coherent whole, which can be done with the neighbours function that I already use.

So I have a rectangle at present, but we could make the blob a small circle of colour and pattern in the center, or a
spiky thing all one colour, or anything in between. My suspicion is that it will STILL be kind of cure if we just also
draw the eyes over the top of it!

This way I also get around my absolute inability to draw.

This could be a blessing in disguise!

Next time: Let's try generating the shape too, within some boundaries.

      <p>Hi there! I&#39;m Dan, an aspiring creative.</p>
      <p>
        My balance has been off in the past - I&#39;ve done too much consuming and not enough creating. This blog is one
        tool I&#39;m employing to help me to rectify that.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have no idea what might be in here in future. I&#39;m interested in tech, music, writing, Capoeira and fitness
        in general, the outdoors, and philosophy (this last in an extremely amateur way).
      </p>
      <p>You can probably expect anything written in here to fall into one of these categories.</p>

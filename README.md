# Dan's blog

After over 10 years in the industry, I'm finally doing what most junior developers do as their first project.

I'm using NextJS with mdx for ease of writing.
I'm intentionally trying to keep this as simple as possible so that I don't abandon it.

## Running in dev mode

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deployment

Non-existent (as of yet).
